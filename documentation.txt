• Email – Automatically checks for a valid email address.  
• Tel – Used for phone numbers with pattern restriction.  
• Textarea – For messages that are longer than one line.  
• Checkbox – Allows users to select multiple options.  
• Radio buttons – Best for selecting one option from a group.  
• Dropdown – To make the form cleaner and save space.  
• Date – Lets the user select a date using a calendar view.  
• Range – Provides a slider input for feedback or rating.  
• Required & Pattern – Used to validate form fields before submitting.

3. How the navigation is set up:

The navigation is created using a <nav> tag and an unordered list.  
Each list item contains a link to a different page:    
• About Me  
• Contact Me

There is also a "Back to Portfolio" link on both the About and Contact pages.  
This helps the user explore the full website smoothly
